Lavla for Python Web Development
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Lavla is a Web Framework for programming Python into websites.

The current version of Lavla is 0.01-dev, as it is still not stable and still in development.  Using Lavla currently is NOT recommended, but if you have any ideas feel free to tell them to us.
